# ICESat-2-Android-App

This app was developed in Summer 2020 for the Crysopheric Sciences Laboratory at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. It allows a user to determine when the [ICESat-2](https://icesat-2.gsfc.nasa.gov/) satellite will be near a particular area using the satellite's Refernce Ground Tracks. Practical applications of this app extend to ground validation campaigns and to civilian scientists working with the Globe Earth app. This app greatly streamlines the process for users as it removes the need for a user to manually parse through thousands of KML files. 

This app was developed using Kotlin and the Android Framework. It implements Google APIs such as Maps and downloads data from an AWS Elastic Beanstalk Webserver that was created host satellite data. 

To run this app on an android device, download and install it from the Google Play Store.
